# About Me
No much to say, really. I'm Simone from Italy (better known online as **Raz**) and I am a freelancer **web designer** & *mostly* **Frontend developer**: I don't like the abuse of the category **full-stack dev** but yeah, I do know how the web stack works and I did work on the backend of several project. I have a strong passion for tech in general and I am an *old* gamer (by the actual standards ðŸ§“) - I love the **rogue like** genre, **arcade**, **hack'n'slash** (Diablo, anyone?) and obviously the goods olds **FPS** like CS, Quake, Doom, COD (yeah, COD is getting better).

Let's jump to the question I'll eventually have to answer:

> Why Raz?

It's a nickname, I've been using it since I was a kid. It's a shortening of *Razor*, and it's a reference to the [Razor](https://dragonlance.fandom.com/wiki/Razor) from the [Dragonlance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance) universe. I've been using it for years!

> What you do for a living?

I started as a web designer and continued as a freelance web dev. I do design custom solutions around the stack I'm most familiar with - Laravel and VueJs. I do not dislike working with nodejs backends though. Since 2021, I started building on the Ethereum blockchain and I love it!

> Why the obsession keyboards and keycaps?

Why not?

One of my first encounters with a **mechanical keyboard** was circa 1995, when my father brought home our first personal computer: it was an IBM Model M. Growing older I moved to mainstream keyboards and then I snatched my first Cherry MX keyboard, a PS2 Filco Majestouch with NKRO.

Plus, one of my hobbies is **photography** but I had nothing to shoot for during the 2020 March lockdown; that's why I started learning [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). The next thing I remember, I was modeling GMK caps and working on my first keyset [GMK Avanguardia](https://raz.wtf/projects/gmk-avanguardia). You can expect me to sometimes update the website with my new keyboard related projects but if you want to get more involved or chit chat during the day, I am part of [Clicky Clack Club](https://discord.gg/H9HCJ4k).

> Why a website?

Hiring peeps usually find me on the web by looking for my name, so I wanted to have a place where I can show my works and my skills. I will treat this website as a portfolio, but also as a personal space where I will share my thoughs and experiences. So yeah, it's going to be a blog, but not a blog.

> I have a question for you!
