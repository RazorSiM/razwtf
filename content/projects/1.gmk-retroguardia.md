### About the set

After a few years since **GMK Avanguardia**, I’m back with something that feels like its rebellious little sibling.
**GMK Retroguardia** keeps the geometric vibe and minimalist layout spirit of Avanguardia, but swaps the muted palette for something with more bite, a vivid green accent that feels both retro and electric. It’s still clean, but this time it’s louder and a little more fun.

### The Concept

::

The name Retroguardia (Italian for “rearguard”) plays on Avanguardia (“avant-garde”); same design lineage, flipped energy.
Think early digital aesthetics, print grids, and sharp contrasting geometry, like something you’d find on an old-school synth interface.

- **Primary color**: same deep blurpleish grey as GMK Avanguardia
- **Accent color**: bright green
- **Extras**: the same indigo GMK Avanguardia highlights just because.
