# Vue Starter
This is my personal take on a Vite + Vue 3 template. If you want to try it:

```bash
degit RazorSiM/vite-vue-ts-starter
pnpm install
```

## Why?
I've been using Vue since forever and I find booring to always start a new project from scratch. This template is my starting point for every new project or proof of concept. It's minimalistic, with only Vue-Router, Pinia and Vueuse installed.
The styling is handled by UnoCSS with sane defaults and presets added.

The only *opinionated* code you'll find in this template is how I handle the **layouting** system. It's very flexible and easy to use and modify for your needs.

On the DX side of the things, I've setup Eslint and Typescript to work out of the box with VSCode. I've also configured VScode to format and fix on save.

Tests are covered by Vitest and Cypress.

## What's included
Here's a list of what's included in this template. Everything has been configured to work out of the box with Eslint, Typescript and VScode.

### Features
- [Vue3](https://vuejs.org);
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/) to handle routes;
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management;
- [Vueuse](https://vueuse.org/) for useful composition API utilities;
- UnoCSS for fast and super customizable styling configured with:
    - [@unocss/reset](https://github.com/unocss/unocss#style-resetting) with Tailwind settings;
    - [@unocss/preset-uno](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/tree/main/packages/preset-uno) as a base preset;
    - [@unocss/preset-icons](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/tree/main/packages/preset-icons) to use icons from [Icones](https://icones.js.org/);
    - [@unocss/preset-web-fonts](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/tree/main/packages/preset-typography) so you can grab your web fonts and set them up easily;
    - [@unocss/transformer-variant-group](https://github.com/unocss/unocss/tree/main/packages/transformer-variant-group) to use the `group` variant; ex: `hover:(bg-blue-500 text-white font-bold)`;
- Scaffolded an example on how you could implement a multi-layout approach

### Development Experience
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for development and production builds;
- Typescript support for `.vue` files;
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) with [antfu/eslint-config](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-config) for linting and formatting;
- [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) for ez git(gud) hooks;
- [Unplugin Auto Import](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import) to automatically import stuff in your files; No more `import { defineComponent } from 'vue'`;
- [Unplugin Vue Components](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-vue-components) to automatically import components;
- [Unplugin Vue Macros](https://github.com/sxzz/unplugin-vue-macros) to extend Vue macros and syntax sugar;
- Vscode will fix and format on save with Eslint;

### Testing
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing;
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for e2e testing;

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
    1) Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
    2) Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```bash
pnpm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with Vitest

```bash
pnpm run test:unit
```

### Run End-to-End Tests with Cypress

```bash
pnpm run test:e2e:dev
```

This runs the end-to-end tests against the Vite development server.
It is much faster than the production build.

But it's still recommended to test the production build with `test:e2e` before deploying (e.g. in CI environments):

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:e2e
```

### Lint, fix and format with Eslint and @antfu/eslint-config settings

```bash
pnpm run lint
```
