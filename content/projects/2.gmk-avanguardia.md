### About the set

I partnered up with my friend and designer Johnnymalandra and came up with the idea of **GMK Avanguardia**:
I chose an Italian word that, as you can guess corresponds to _Avant-guard_ or _Vanguard_,
referring to all those extreme, daring, and innovative artists with a futuristic sight capable of anticipating their times.

I have seen that sets featuring themes related to modern pop culture have always been appreciated, so I thought, why not pay respect to a great artist who influenced it the most in shapes and colors.
More than content, this set draws its inspiration from **Kandinsky's words**:

> Art goes beyond the limits in which time would like to compress it and indicates the content in the future

The Color Palette

We especially referred to **Vasilij Vasil‚Äôeviƒç Kandinskij** and this painting to get the inspiration for the **novelties**:

We wanted to give our concept a more personal interpretation by using a palette oriented towards the tech world and so the result is down here!

I would like to thank all my friends from the **ClickyClackClub Italian community** for the support they showed me and Johnnymalandra for the awesome artworks!
