Hi there, elcome to my personal space! I've built this website several times to try out new technologies and stay up-to-date with the javascript ecosystem. This current version is based on [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com) and [Content v2](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)! You'll find some of my [projects](/projects) and other things I've worked on here. The content might be a bit random, so please bear with me! If you want to know more about me as a person, I have a [dedicated page](/about). If you want to reach out, you can follow the links above. And by the way, I love emojis, so you'll find some sprinkled throughout the site ðŸ«¡
