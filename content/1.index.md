title: What, how and why
---
Welcome to my personal space. I've built this website several times, with different frameworks, to explore new technologies, patterns, libraries and to stay up to date with the javascript ecosystem. This current version is based on [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com) and [Content v2](https://content.nuxtjs.org/)! Here you'll find some of my [projects](/projects) and other things done by me. The contents are going to be a bit random, so bear with me! If you want to know something more about who I am (as a human), I have a [dedicated page](/about). If you want to get in touch with me, you can follow the links above.

PS: I like emojis, you'll find some here and there ðŸ«¡
